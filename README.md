# Student Placement System Web Application
It's web version of student placement system. 
# Proposal
The project is about 4+4+4 education system. The education system is working this like; students must be receive 4 years education in primary school and 4 years education in secondary school. Students are placed to these schools except highschool by their location and address information,but there is a problem with this. Our government doesnâ€™t have sensitiviy about placing by location. For example, there are two secondary schools for the student in the same district, but the student is placed to distant school. For this reason, the student have to go to school with schoolbus. Students are placed randomly by the government and some problems happened with it. 
We thought that we can solve these problems and extra expenses for these students. Parents of students can choose school where their children receive education, so they can send a report to the government as a foreknowledge. Main idea is that parents can choose the closest school for their children. The foreknowledge provides government to place properly students to schools.
There will be two entities in the system as students and administrator. Students can login to system with password which is identified themselves and choose a school that they want to go by their precinct. The chosen school by the student is sent as a report, and the administrator can control the sending reports by retrieving data from database. If the chosen school is applicable, the administrator confirms the report. If the chosen school is not applicable, the administrator deletes the report and student can send one more report about the choice. The students are placed on approval.
The system will be used on a desktop application and website. To create a desktop application, Java programming language with SWT or Swing will be used. On the website hand, PHP and HTML languages will be used. To execute database operations and connections, MySQL database system will be worked.
